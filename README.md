# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



STEPS to do

#1 - INSTALL PAKAGES

redux toolkit 
react-redux
axios

#2 build slices and store (reducer and actions are integrated in slices with the help of redux toolkit)

#3 -  set up provider(import from react-redux) connect store in main.js
